	- **IPsec Tunnel Mode VPN**

## 7.6 Conduct Incident Management

### Incident Management Phases

#### Detection

- Use *IDS/IPS*, signature detection, etc. to ovserve system behaviors
- Follow up on threat intel
- system testing and auditing
- **Threat Hunting and Indicators of Compromise**

#### Response

**Response time ‚àù Impacts + Costs**

CIRT/CSIRT - Incident Response Teams

#### Mitigation

**Common Mitigations**
- Isolation
- Temporary new controls
- monitoring
- address vulns
- suspend or revoke access

*Considerations*
- Volatile data preservation
- Critical Systems Prioritization
- Legal

#### Reporting

*Effective Reports Concepts:*
- Timely/Accurate Reporting
- Responsive to Requirements
- Adaptive to protect stakeholders and different project lifecycles
- Discretion in external reporting
- attentive to protective data (PII/PHI)

#### Recovery/Remediation

**Recovery Phase** - restore affected systems to normal functionality
**Remediation Phase** - address root causes and implement corrective measures

### Incident Response Frameworks

**Common IR frameworks & standards:**
- ***NIST 800-61*** - Computer security incident handling guide
- **ISO/IEC 27035**
- SANS Guidance
- CERT Publications
- ENISA Incident Handling Guide
- OASIS CIRT
- ISACA IRMF
- ITIL Incident response framework
- DHS CIRP

## 7.7 Operate and Maintain Detection & Preventative Measures


### Secure Network Architecture

**Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)** - a small network between internal and external network offering security and privacy

**Screened Subnet** - a network segment between the internal and external networks (Network DMZ)
- Use *Bastion Hosts* as hosts will be attacked

#### Firewalls

![](Pasted%20image%2020241212114219.png)

*Application Layer Firewall*
- does NAT/PAT and replaces IP/PORT with chosen ones
- Laggy, so it caches data

*Application Level Proxy Firewall*
- layer 7 firewall
- does stateful packet inspection
- anonymizes sender information
- HTTPS interceptor

**Web Application Firewall**
- proxy for web server
- reverse proxy does load balancing

#### IDS/IPS

Know that an IDS *monitors*, and IPS *prevents*
- NIDS - detection across network
- HIDS - installed on individual workstation

*Common IDS Techniques*
- Behavior / Anomaly
- Signature

#### Honeypots

Systems placed in a *DMZ* with many open ports/services with known vulnerabilities.

**HoneyNet** - 2+ honeyports simulating a network

**HoneyToken** - a file or component that generates an intrusion alert when accessed

**Padded Cell** - an isolate environment emulating a part of an internal network to isolate an attacker

##### Issues

- *Enticement* vs. *Entrapment*
- If a honeypot is too close to production, then it can leak realistic information

#### Backups

Use *Full site backups* stored off-site. *Failovers* allow temporary switching to a redundant system.

**Backup Types**
- *Full*
- *Differential* - backs up data since last full backup
- *Incremental* - backs up data since last backup of any kind

**Snapshots** - a saved state of operation

### Recovery Sites

![](Pasted%20image%2020241212135615.png)

**Hot Site** - fully operational site equipped with standard hardware/software

**Warm Site** - somewhere between hot/cold sites (may not have the software needed for restoration)

**Cold Site** - facility without the computer equipment in place to restore operation

## 7.11 Implement Disaster Recovery Processes

### Set Recovery Objectives
#weak_area 

#### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

**BIA** is a method of gathering data to predict how system loss will affect a business.

###### Key Steps
1. *Identify Mission Essential Functions*
2. *Risk Assessment to determine risk exposure to critical systems*

###### Key Metrics

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** - Time to which data must be recovered after an outage (i.e last 12 hours must be available from backups)

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** - Length if time a system can be in the recovery phase before negatively affecting the business

**Maximum Tolerable Downtime** - maximum outage time 

*Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)* - time it takes for a system to fail

*Mean Time to Repair (MTBR)* - time it takes to repair a system after failure
