# Domain 6: Security Assessment & Testing

## 6.1 Design & Validate Assessment, Test, & Audit Strategies

### Security Assessments

**Key Areas**
- Design and validate assessment strategies
- conduct security controls testing
- collect security process data
- analyze test output and generate reports
- conduct security audits

**NIST 800-115** - Technical Guide for Security Testing & Assessment


### Assessment & Test Planning

**Steps:**
1. *Establish an information security assessment policy*
2. *Create or evaluate T&E strategies*
3. *Monitor the T&E process*
4. *Evaluate test plans for operational testing*
5. *Include T&E concerns in requirements/design analysisa*

## 6.2 Conduct Security Controls Testing

**Vulnerability Assessment** - controls and operations verification.
**Penetration Testing** - ethical hacking to validate weaknesses
- *Black Box Test*
- *Gray Box Test*
- *White Box Test*


## 6.3 Collect Security Process Data

#### Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM)

**ISCM** - defined per the **NIST 800-137**

#### Report Test Outputs

Report assessments results in accordance with organizational policies/procedures

**Report information should be *SMART*:**
- *Specific*
- *Measurable*
- *Attainable/realistic*
- *Repeatable* - Able to be tied to a timeline
- *Timely*

### Service Organization Control (SOC) Reporting

**Service Organization Control (SOC) Reports:**
- *SOC1 Reports* - focus on financial and auditable controls (**FOR EXECUTIVES**)
	- *SOC 1 Type 1* - scoped to a particular date
	- *SOC 2 Type 2* - scoped to a date range
- *SOC2 Reports* - focus on controls covering CIA and privacy. (**FOR CLIENTS**)
	- also has type 1/2 reports based on date/date range
- *SOC3 Reports*

## 6.4 Analyze Test Output & Generate Report

### Remediation

The process of addressing and resolving identified vulnerabilities

#### Exception Handling 

**Process:**
1. Exception Identification
2. Documentation
3. Risk Assessment
4. Monitoring/Review

## 6.5 Conduct or Facilitate Security Audits

- Regulatory
- Assessment
- Third-Party
- Examinations
